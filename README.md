Website for Steadfast Messenger


This site is a redesign of the old Steadfast Messenger website. The design was created form scratch with new branding, colorways, images and typography.
I worked with the client to determine their needs and the needs for customers throughout the design process.

The site was coded using HTML, CSS, Javascript (for form validation) and PHP (for form submission to an email address).
